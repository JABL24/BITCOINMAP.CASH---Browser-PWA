# bitcoinmap.cash

This repo contains the website for bitcoinmap.cash which is hosted on Firebase

It is written in plain Java Script

The directory part is hosted on Hetzner because Firebase does not allow PHP

The merchants list could easily be build with JavaScript and could be made more responsive and more beautiful!

Feel free to collaborate!!! All Pull requests are Welcome!!!

I will be travelling for a long time, so I would be happy if someone takes over the project!
